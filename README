ppdRPG makes the process of creating simple role playing games easier by
providing "libraries" and templates so the developer can focus on the characters
and on the plot - the fun part - rather than on creating functions and 
troubleshooting. To start creating NPCs, places, objects... just adjust the
configurations on configs.py, import ppdRPG and then from ppdRPG import *.

Create said characters, which are instances of the classes provided by ppdRPG,
save them to the database and start coding your game. You can access all
instances AND their methods from the database thanks to the wonderful Python
method "shelve". Said methods are the core of this application. For example,
instead of having to create functions to move an NPC in a place, the developper
can simply use npcInstance.reach(position). Check the wiki for more help. Use
help('lib.LIBRARY.CLASS') or help('lib.LIBRARY.CLASS.METHOD') for help.

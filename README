ppdRPG makes the process of creating simple role playing games easier by
providing "libraries" and templates so the developer can focus on the characters
and on the plot - the fun part - rather than on creating functions and 
troubleshooting.

It is a small project I started to learn a bit more Python and for my personal 
use only. However, some people said they were interested in it, so I decided 
to make it an open project for whoever wants to contribute or fork it. 
It's currently on it's early stages of development and does not provide much.

See https://github.com/a442/ppdRPG/wiki for help. Or, after importing ppdRPG,
use Python "help" built-in on the class or method you need help with.
